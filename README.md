# MoveSingleAPI SDK in Swift

## Installation ðŸ’»
You can use Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in the `Package.swift` file or by adding it directly within Xcode.

`.package(url: "https://github.com/move-ai/MoveSingleAPISwift", from: "1.0.0")`

## Usage ðŸ¤©
Import the framework in your project:
```swift
import MoveSingleAPISwift
```

[Create an MoveSingleAPI key](https://move.ai) and add it to your configuration:
```swift
let move = Move(apiKey: "TOKEN")`
```

### Create simple Take
```swift
let take = try await move.createTake(
    takeID: UUID().uuidString, 
    videoURL: // URL to local video file
)
```

### Upload Take
Uploads the video file and the meta data and creates a new take in the system.
```swift
try await take.upload()
```

### Create Job
Take has to be uploaded. This creates a new job that runs the video through the pipeline to generate the animation.
```swift
try await take.createJob()
```

### Get Results
To check for a result, update the status of the current job of the Take, which is the last one created. As soon as the state of the is `finished` the outputfiles can be downloaded.
```swift
try await take.currentJob?.update()
if take.currentJob?.state == .finished {
    try await take.currentJob?.outputFiles[.preview]?.download()
    let localPreviewURL = await take.currentJob?.outputFiles[.preview]?.localURL
}
```

### Create Take with EnhancementData
Enhancement Data is an optional Array of `EnhancementData` for every frame of the video.

#### CameraDesignData
`CameraDesignData` holds the internal size and position data of the camera. The information is extracted a given `CMSampleBuffer`.

```swift
let cameraDesignData = CameraDesignData(from: CMSampleBuffer)
```

#### CameraPositionData
`CameraPositionData` holds the values of different Sensors of the device.
```swift
let cameraPositionData = CameraPositionData(
    gyroData: CMGyroData?, 
    accelerometerData: CMAccelerometerData?, 
    magnetometerData: CMMagnetometerData?, 
    deviceMotion: CMDeviceMotion?
)
```

#### DepthSensorData
`DepthSensorData` holds the depth data provided by the camera
```swift
let depthSensorData = DepthSensorData(depthData: AVDepthData)
```

With theses three values the `EnhancementData` for one frame can be build. All values are optional, but increase the quality of the output.
```swift
let enhancementData = EnhancementData(
    cameraDesignData: cameraDesignData, 
    cameraPositionData: cameraPositionData, 
    depthSensorData: depthSensorData
)

let take = try await move.createTake(
    takeID: UUID().uuidString, 
    videoURL: // URL to local video file,
    enhancementData: enhancementData
)
```
